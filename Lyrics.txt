I only ache In the wake Of a broken never There is no thrill In the crime I have lost the pleasure Skin on skin means nothing If there is no blood to bleed Simply quenching hunger Doesn't kill the need Hands always move On their own Self-inflicted torture Feel, imitate Stimulate Futuristic horrors Basking in the glory Of our manufactured vice Fade away to nothing 'Cause now nothing will suffice I don't mean to make you nervous I've been sad, but not depressed Wasting breath waiting for nothing 'Cause you won't apologize Apologize Clean the mess that you made Own up to the blame At the end of the day So easy to say It's not your fault now It's not your fault now Apologize Nails on my skin Just to check If my heart's still beating Head in my hands Only I Hear the quiet screaming Shaking turns to crying In my short-lived fake delight The bitterness of trying Haunts me through the night And I don't mean to make you nervous I've been sad, but not depressed Lately, I've been feeling something When I'm high up on my meds I'm smiling at a screen Wearing a name that's not my own It's only in these moments When you truly feel alone Apologize Apologize Clean the mess that you made Own up to the blame At the end of the day So easy to say It's not your fault now It's not your fault now A name on a screen Means nothing to me Hypnotic machine Your hands are clean It's not your fault now It's not your fault now Apologize Clean the mess that you made Own up to the blame At the end of the day So easy to say It's not your fault now It's not your fault now El hambre que está consumiendo tu interior Que sin esfuerzo puedo yo saciar La sed que te da, solo me hace recordar Con qué poco yo te puedo ahogar Sin fallar, lo que tú puedas necesitar Aquí va a estar, aquí está Dime, ¿qué más quieres? Ya no te lo niegues A escondidas cobro Me lo llevo todo De mí no te vas a esconder Sé que siempre vas a volver Aunque a veces quieras escapar Yo sé que aquí te vas a quedar Pretendo sanar la misma herida que yo abrí Te lastimo y aún vuelves a mí Al manipular el poder que tú me das Yo decido cómo es el final Sin fallar, lo que tú puedas necesitar Aquí va a estar, aquí está Dime, ¿qué más quieres? Ya no te lo niegues A escondidas cobro Me lo llevo todo De mí no te vas a esconder Sé que siempre vas a volver Aunque a veces quieras escapar Yo sé que aquí te vas a quedar Dime, ¿qué más quieres? Dime, ¿qué más quieres? Dime, ¿qué más quieres? Dime, ¿qué más quieres? ¡Si ya vas a volver! Dime, ¿qué más quieres? Ya no te lo niegues (¡no lo niegues!) A escondidas cobro Me lo llevo todo De mí no te vas a esconder Sé que siempre vas a volver Sabes cómo va a terminar Pero aquí te vas a quedar Dime, ¿qué más quieres? There's something pulling me away Something criminal but I can't fight it Won't you tell me what to say? Or pull me in and keep me nice and quiet Keep me here, closer in the clear Just kill the noise, won't you fill my void? Give it all up, won't you feed my senses? You know you love it You love me when I need you, do you need me? Yeah! You know I love it, I love it when you feed me Yet you leave me begging for more I feel it slowly creeping in I find desire leaves me frozen, stranded Waiting between what could've been Why am I sinking when I'm fully grounded? Standing still, go in for the kill Just kill the noise, won't you fill my void? Give it all up, won't you feed my senses? You know you love it You love me when I need you, do you need me? Yeah!
